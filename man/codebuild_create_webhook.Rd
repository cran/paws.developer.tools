\title{For an existing CodeBuild build project that has its source code stored
in a GitHub or Bitbucket repository, enables CodeBuild to start
rebuilding the source code every time a code change is pushed to the
repository}
\usage{
codebuild_create_webhook(
  projectName,
  branchFilter = NULL,
  filterGroups = NULL,
  buildType = NULL,
  manualCreation = NULL,
  scopeConfiguration = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{projectName}{[required] The name of the CodeBuild project.}

\item{branchFilter}{A regular expression used to determine which repository branches are
built when a webhook is triggered. If the name of a branch matches the
regular expression, then it is built. If \code{branchFilter} is empty, then
all branches are built.

It is recommended that you use \code{filterGroups} instead of \code{branchFilter}.}

\item{filterGroups}{An array of arrays of \code{WebhookFilter} objects used to determine which
webhooks are triggered. At least one \code{WebhookFilter} in the array must
specify \code{EVENT} as its \code{type}.

For a build to be triggered, at least one filter group in the
\code{filterGroups} array must pass. For a filter group to pass, each of its
filters must pass.}

\item{buildType}{Specifies the type of build this webhook will trigger.

\code{RUNNER_BUILDKITE_BUILD} is only available for \code{NO_SOURCE} source type
projects configured for Buildkite runner builds. For more information
about CodeBuild-hosted Buildkite runner builds, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-runner-buildkite.html}{Tutorial: Configure a CodeBuild-hosted Buildkite runner}
in the \emph{CodeBuild user guide}.}

\item{manualCreation}{If manualCreation is true, CodeBuild doesn't create a webhook in GitHub
and instead returns \code{payloadUrl} and \code{secret} values for the webhook.
The \code{payloadUrl} and \code{secret} values in the output can be used to
manually create a webhook within GitHub.

\code{manualCreation} is only available for GitHub webhooks.}

\item{scopeConfiguration}{The scope configuration for global or organization webhooks.

Global or organization webhooks are only available for GitHub and Github
Enterprise webhooks.}
